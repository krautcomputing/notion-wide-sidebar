# DEPRECATED

Since August 21, 2018, the Notion sidebar is resizable, so this extension is no longer needed.

# Notion Wide Sidebar

This is a small Chrome extension, that makes the sidebar on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) wider. I love Notion but it always bothered me that the sidebar was only 230px wide with no option to resize it... if you have one or two subfolders and more than two words in your page titles, it will be very hard to navigate in such a small sidebar.

The only thing this Chrome extension does is to add a line of CSS that resizes the sidebar to 400px width. If you use this extension but want a different width, get in touch (or open a PR) and I'll implement an options page that makes the width configurable.

## Installation

Clone this repo and load it in Chrome via "Load unpacked extension..."

## Usage

Nothing to configure, simply open [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and enjoy the wide sidebar!
